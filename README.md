# Collision A* (A star)
A reimplementation of A star algorithm that consider anti-collision controls and collisions risks.
This version is supposed to be used in contexts of AGVs path finding, where the definition of a new path must consider the presence of other vehicles and the risk associated to collisions with people (i.e., human operators).
